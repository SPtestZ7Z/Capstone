These note books describe a project submitted for the IBM Professional Certificate in Data Science, and include an analysis of data for rocket launches managed by SpaceX.

Data is collected from different sources, including an API (Module 1.1) and Web scrapibng (Module 1.2). 

The data is prepared through various data wrangling exercises (MOdule 1.3).

Data is explored and visualised using Matplotlib (Module 2).

The launch sites and corresponding success rates of those launches is plotted on a map using Folium (Module 3.1)

A dashoboard is created using Dash to visualise and filter the launch success data, showing various relationships (Module 3.1)

Mahcine learning models are created and evaluated to find the best predictive model for launch success as a function of the various independent variables, such as launch site, booster type, year of launch and payload (Module 4).
